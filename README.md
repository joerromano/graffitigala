# GraffitiGala
A hack from Hack@Brown 2018.

# Getting started
1. Put in your own Firebase database API key, auth domain, database URL, project ID, and messaging sender ID in the object on line 155 of `graffiti.html`.
2. Serve the HTML so you can access via your phone.
3. Navigate to the correct URL in an AR-enabled browser like [WebARonARCore](https://github.com/google-ar/WebARonARCore) or [WebARonARKit](https://github.com/google-ar/WebARonARKit).
